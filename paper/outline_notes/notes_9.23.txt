KG$ notes @{cite korsgaardFUL}. p. 8-> maxims include reasons.
p. 14 -> impossible actions are permissible.
need a purpose or end-> overall article

KG$ Sources. p. 86 -> two parts, act and the end
internal structure. hmm?

KG$ Acting on a Reason.
208- what properties of actions give us reasons? is it just the goal? (if so a maxim is self-contained).
209 - things that play a role in deliberation, call out to agents 
210 - agent must take properties to be good making 
214 - not just in accordance with normative concern, but on it 
consciousness of your own appropriateness - reflexive property
215 - acting on a reason requires being conscious of your reason - but that's not concern for others 
217 - aristotle calls action == logos == principle
    time, way, object, and end (all have to be right to be good)
    action INCLUDES aim
218 - you choose the whole pacakge for its own sake: to-do-this-act-for-the-sake-of-this-end
    different end == different maxim == different test
219 - form: "I will do act A for end E"
    act may be the end - dancing for its own sake or for the sheerjoy of dancing 
    do certain acts have ends built into them? dancing is always done for the sake of moving in time with music?
    is it dancing if they're shooting bullets at you? or dodging?
221 - purpose is part of an action 
222 - why did the agent think it was worth doing - should be self contained in a maxim 
223 - order where this is universal practice AND you simultaneously will the maxim 
224 - wrongness of act - type really is wrong of actions that fall under that act type 
      maybe represent this as (all action with this act are wrong)
228 - the reason is the action itself 

SEP. I will A in C in order to realize or produce E.

Kitcher, What is a Maxim. 
p. 4 - tailoring objection - YAY. relevant for applications 
p. 6 - O'Niell \<rightarrow> if circumstance, I ought to action (action as in KG or act?)
      in C I ought to A for P \<rightarrow> exactly what DDL does
      BUT, this would be neutral wrt moral content (is that true?)
p. 7 - practical maxims are obvious to anyone with worldly knowledge (are they truth apt?)
      maxim is a rule for life - isn't that just the CI?
      ah, religion within the limits of mere reason 
p. 8 - is an imperative different from a maxim? ***
p. 11 - maxim is a principle that contains a judgement (Wolff)
p. 13 - in C I ought to do A for P because that would be G (Type of goodness)
    for Kant, G == duty 
    moral law makes the first 3 placeholders 
p. 14 - but what do you feed into FUL if G is already indicated 
p. 15 - just remove the self love component 
p. 16 - FUL says ``in C, everyone ought to do A for P" or ``in C, everyone ought to do A for P or not 
        as they please." So good maxim is "in C, I ought to do A for P because <insert one formulation of FUL"
        look in notes for more readings on FUL
p. 16-20 - maxims of self love or moral maxims. hm.
p. 20 - if you made this decision once, you're committing to it again
        so do you just need all the info necessary to make the decision? that's a hard epistemic question 
        this is super relevant to application tests 
        only need "morally relevant" info
p. 21 - garbage in/ garbage out 
p. 22 - genuine self deception should be a false positive - interesting kind of tests 
        USEFUL for miscellaneous tests 
p. 25 - generate hypotheses (self love) and test them (FUL)

Ebels-Duggan, Kantian Ethics
p. 1- Realists disagree with Constructivists, who think that it's an entire self-contained objective theory
p. 6- motive of duty 
      ``in accord with duty" vs ``from duty"
p. 7 - not about a specific set of goals
p. 9- heteronomous source is subjective and conditional
    - procedural moral realism
p. 11 - sensitivity to context and ex of judgement 
    - rule out bad ways of acting
p. 11- Rawls \<rightarrow> ``unless Z" (just context?) Hill \<rightarrow> ``from motive M" (Kitcher)
p. 12 - practical contradiction view is largely accepted \<rightarrow> nice!
p. 16 - FUL doesn't help show WHY a particular action is wrong 
      maybe it does - free riding, making an exception of yourself

Kant doesn't think this could be mechanized (Ebels Duggan)
test if a certain interpretation of FUL can be mechanized 
- just going to pick this one and see if that's possible 
what is the human doing vs what is the robot doing 
what would kant think? analytic vs synthetic?
bases covered bc KG$ has the dominant interpretation 
  here are some other possiblities, im not going to consider them in a footnote
constructivists vs realists get murky 
  im going to formalize FUL because this is an early attempt 
  make a choice and say in the footnote that these are the alternatives so you know that i know 
  (1) easy (2) constructivist (3) kant says they're all the same so who cares
  - don't need to take a stance on this 
  - back pocket to show bona fides for talking about different interpretations 
- action vs act korsgaard
- KG only has act and end, Kitcher and Ebels Duggan adds circumstance 
- can you use context in tailoring objection/application section
