section "Applications"

text \<open>In this section, I will demonstrate possible applications of my formalization of the FUL. I 
will present two kinds of applications. First, I will formalize a classical ethical dilemma in 
Kantian literature, the case of the murderer at the door. This will demonstrate the utility of computational
ethics in helping philosophers think about ethical dilemmas. Second, I will encode some ``common sense"
facts into the system and then test the results of applying this more powerful system to common
ethical dilemmas. This section will serve as a prototype of the kind of reasoning that this kind of 
computational ethics can do and will demonstrate the utility of computational ethics in performing 
everyday ethical reasoning. Finally, I will also philosophically analyze the possibility and value of 
applications like these. Specifically, I will consider to what extent humans should let computers do 
ethical reasoning on our behalf.   \<close>
