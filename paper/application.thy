section "Applications"

text \<open>In this section, I will demonstrate possible applications of my formalization of the FUL. I 
will present two kinds of applications. First, I will formalize a classical ethical dilemma in 
Kantian literature, the case of the murderer at the door. This will demonstrate the utility of computational
ethics in helping philosophers think about ethical dilemmas. Second, I will encode some ``common sense"
facts into the system and then test the results of applying this more powerful system to common
ethical dilemmas. This section will serve as a prototype of the kind of reasoning that this kind of 
computational ethics can do and will demonstrate the utility of computational ethics in performing 
everyday ethical reasoning. Finally, I will also philosophically analyze the possibility and value of 
applications like these. Specifically, I will consider to what extent humans should let computers do 
ethical reasoning on our behalf. 

who do you need to trust?

how is it different from consequentialism if it still requires common sense reasoning?

theory doesn't give guidance on how to make common sense judgements 

only care about universal property 
methodology to classify atoms 

some set of fact axioms that cover some interesting space of things 
obligatory and forbidden things 
how does it compose 
lie and retract

few versions of the fact database
you have an intuition, what do you have to do to make it fit into the theory?

computational ethics and also this is the work you need to do in order to use it in practice 
take a stupid case - axioms that are reasonable and result in bad conclusions 

higher order patterns -> things cancel each other more generally 

prior work -> value 
what is the value? you don't want to
facts can look very similar and one goes to one outcome and one to the other 

FACCT -> send Nada link and think about what to submit 
would it be stronger as a unit 
computational ethics should be a thing
