abstract = {Sledgehammer is a component of Isabelle/HOL that employs firstorder automatic theorem provers (ATPs) to discharge goals arising in interactive proofs. It heuristically selects relevant facts and, if an ATP is successful, produces a snippet that replays the proof in Isabelle. We extended Sledgehammer to invoke satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers as well, exploiting its relevance filter and parallel architecture. Isabelle users are now pleasantly surprised by SMT proofs for problems beyond the ATPs' reach. Remarkably, the best SMT solver performs better than the best ATP on most of our benchmarks},

abstract = {While various traditions under the 'virtue ethics' umbrella have been studied extensively
and advocated by ethicists, it has not been clear that there exists a version of virtue
ethics rigorous enough to be a target for machine ethics (which we take to include
the engineering of an ethical sensibility in a machine or robot itself, not only the
study of ethics in the humans who might create artificial agents). We begin to address
this by presenting an embryonic formalization of a key part of any virtue-ethics theory:
namely, the learning of virtue by a focus on exemplars of moral virtue. Our work is
based in part on a computational formal logic previously used to formally model other
ethical theories and principles therein, and to implement these models in artificial
agents.},

abstract = {Performance of supercomputers has been steadily and exponentially increasing for the past 20 years, and is expected to increase further. This unprecedented computational power enables us to build and simulate large-scale neural network models composed of tens of billions of neurons and tens of trillions of synapses with detailed anatomical connections and realistic physiological parameters. Such “human-scale” brain simulation could be considered a milestone in computational neuroscience and even in general neuroscience. Towards this milestone, it is mandatory to introduce modern high-performance computing technology into neuroscience research. In this article, we provide an introductory landscape about large-scale brain simulation on supercomputers from the viewpoints of computational neuroscience and modern high-performance computing technology for specialists in experimental as well as computational neurosciences. This introduction to modeling and simulation methods is followed by a review of various representative large-scale simulation studies conducted to date. Then, we direct our attention to the cerebellum, with a review of more simulation studies specific to that region. Furthermore, we present recent simulation results of a human-scale cerebellar network model composed of 86 billion neurons on the Japanese flagship supercomputer K (now retired). Finally, we discuss the necessity and importance of human-scale brain simulation, and suggest future directions of such large-scale brain simulation research.}

abstract = {How do configurations of humans and algorithms evolve as firms adopt artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and what are the implications for work and organization? We explored these questions through a two-year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work. Drawing on a human–machine configuration perspective, we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis. In contrast to replacing human work, the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human-in-the-loop pattern, comprised of both the augmentation work of auditing (i.e. the generation of a ground truth and assessment of the algorithmic output against this) as well as the work of altering the algorithm and the data acquisition architecture. Our research points to the strategic importance of a human-in-the-loop pattern for organizational reflexivity to ensure that the performance of the algorithm meets the organization’s requirements and changes in the environment.}

With that, Kant insists on deriving all morality from reason alone. Such is the Categorical Imperative that Kant lays at the basis of ethics. Yet while negative duties can be derived from the Categorical Imperative and thus from reason, the paper argues that this is not the case with positive duties. After answering a number of attempts to derive positive duties from the Categorical Imperative, most notably those of Barbara Herman, it sketches an alternative approach to understanding the relationship between the universal moral law and specific moral contents.},

 abstract = {Although Kant is often considered the founding father of the controversial principle 'Ought Implies Can' (OIC), it is not at all clear how Kant himself understands and defends this principle. This essay provides a substained interpretation of Kant's views on OIC. I argue that Kant endorses two versions of OIC: a version that is concerned with our physical capacities, and a version that posits a link between moral obligation and a volitional power of choice. I show that although there are important senses in which Kant's conception of OIC differs from the way in which OIC is discussed in recent philosophy, his account raises important issues for contemporary theory: for instance, it highlights the extent to which acceptance or rejection of OIC reflects convictions about the sources of normativity.},

abstract = {abstract  The United States Army's Future Combat Systems Project, which aims to manufacture a ‘robot army’ to be ready for deployment by 2012, is only the latest and most dramatic example of military interest in the use of artificially intelligent systems in modern warfare. This paper considers the ethics of the decision to send artificially intelligent robots into war, by asking who we should hold responsible when an autonomous weapon system is involved in an atrocity of the sort that would normally be described as a war crime. A number of possible loci of responsibility for robot war crimes are canvassed: the persons who designed or programmed the system, the commanding officer who ordered its use, the machine itself. I argue that in fact none of these are ultimately satisfactory. Yet it is a necessary condition for fighting a just war, under the principle of jus in bellum, that someone can be justly held responsible for deaths that occur in the course of the war. As this condition cannot be met in relation to deaths caused by an autonomous weapon system it would therefore be unethical to deploy such systems in warfare.},
