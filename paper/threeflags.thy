text \<open>Explain the three flags I'm planting:

(1) Only formalizing the FUL -> Easiest and most mechanical, most prior attempts focus on this one as 
well. Kant says they're all the same so who cares. Footnote: constructivists like it but I'm not 
committing to that view.

(2) Formalizing this particular view of a maxim. Copy and clean from 4.1

(3) Formalizing the practical contradiction interpretation -> Present the three interpretations. recreate
Korsgaard's argument for it. Point out that most people accept her argument. \<close>
