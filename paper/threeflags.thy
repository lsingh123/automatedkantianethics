text \<open>The literature on Kantian ethics is expansive and complicated. To focus my thesis on the contributions 
of automated ethics to Kantian thought, I make the following choices, backed by philosphical literature.

First, I am only studying formalizations of Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative, 
the formula of universal law. 


Explain the three flags I'm planting:

(1) Only formalizing the FUL -> Easiest and most mechanical, most prior attempts focus on this one as 
well. Kant says they're all the same so who cares. Footnote: constructivists like it but I'm not 
committing to that view. O'Niell 33 talks about it being formal and precise.

(2) Formalizing this particular view of a maxim. Copy and clean from 4.1

(3) Formalizing the practical contradiction interpretation -> Present the three interpretations. recreate
Korsgaard's argument for it. Point out that most people accept her argument. \<close>
